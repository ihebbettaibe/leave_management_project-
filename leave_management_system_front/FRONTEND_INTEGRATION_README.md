# Frontend Real Data Integration

This document outlines the changes made to integrate real data from the backend API into the Angular frontend application.

## üîÑ Changes Made

### 1. **API Services Created**

#### `src/app/private/services/api.service.ts`
- Centralized service for all API calls
- Handles authentication tokens automatically
- Provides methods for:
  - Profile management (get, update, upload profile picture)
  - Dashboard data retrieval
  - Leave requests (submit, get my requests)
  - Leave types (get available types)
  - Calendar events and holidays

#### `src/app/private/services/auth.service.ts`
- Authentication service with token management
- User state management with BehaviorSubject
- Login/logout functionality
- Role-based access control helpers

### 2. **Component Updates**

#### Dashboard Component (`user-dashboard.ts`)
- **Before**: Used static dummy data
- **After**: 
  - Loads real data from `/profile/dashboard` API endpoint
  - Shows loading states and error handling
  - Dynamically updates employee information and leave balances
  - Refresh functionality

#### Profile Component (`user-profile.ts`)
- **Before**: Static profile information and image
- **After**:
  - Loads real profile data from `/profile/me` API endpoint
  - Profile image upload functionality with `/profile/upload-picture`
  - Edit profile with real API integration
  - Form validation and error handling
  - Loading states for all operations

#### Leave Requests Component (`user-leave-requests.ts`)
- **Before**: Dummy form submission
- **After**:
  - Loads real leave types from `/leave-types` API
  - Submits to real API `/leave-requests` endpoint
  - File upload support for attachments
  - Dynamic leave type validation based on API data
  - Success/error notifications

#### Calendar Component (`user-calender.ts`)
- **Before**: Static calendar events
- **After**:
  - Loads calendar events from `/calendar/events` API
  - Integrates holidays from `/holidays` API
  - Shows user's approved leave requests
  - Month navigation with data refresh

### 3. **Environment Configuration**

#### `src/environments/environment.ts` & `environment.development.ts`
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
};
```

### 4. **Template Updates**

#### Profile Template
- Added file input for image uploads
- Dynamic data binding for profile information
- Loading indicators and error states

#### Dashboard Template
- Loading spinner during data fetch
- Error messages with retry functionality
- Dynamic content based on API response

## üéØ Key Features Added

### **Real Data Integration**
- All components now fetch data from the backend API
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Automatic token management for authenticated requests

### **Profile Image Management**
- Upload profile pictures to the server
- Support for JPEG, PNG, GIF formats
- File size validation (max 5MB)
- Instant UI updates after successful upload

### **Dynamic Leave Management**
- Leave types loaded from database
- Real-time form validation based on API data
- File attachments for leave requests
- Success/error feedback

### **Enhanced User Experience**
- Loading indicators for all API calls
- Error handling with retry options
- Real-time data updates
- Form validation with backend integration

## üîß API Endpoints Used

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/auth/login` | POST | User authentication |
| `/profile/me` | GET | Get current user profile |
| `/profile` | PUT | Update profile information |
| `/profile/upload-picture` | POST | Upload profile picture |
| `/profile/dashboard` | GET | Get dashboard data |
| `/leave-types` | GET | Get available leave types |
| `/leave-requests` | POST | Submit leave request |
| `/leave-requests/me` | GET | Get my leave requests |
| `/calendar/events` | GET | Get calendar events |
| `/holidays` | GET | Get holidays |

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### **For Developers**

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd leave-management-system_back
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend Server**:
   ```bash
   cd leave_management_system_front
   ng serve
   ```

3. **Database Connection**:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is running with the real data
   - Backend should be connected to the `leave_management_system` database

### **For Users**

1. **Login**: Use credentials from the seeded database
2. **Dashboard**: View real employee information and leave balances
3. **Profile**: Upload profile pictures and edit information
4. **Leave Requests**: Submit requests with file attachments
5. **Calendar**: View real calendar events and holidays

## üìä Data Flow

```
Frontend Component ‚Üí API Service ‚Üí Backend API ‚Üí Database
                  ‚Üê              ‚Üê             ‚Üê
```

1. User interacts with UI
2. Component calls API service method
3. API service sends HTTP request with auth token
4. Backend processes request and queries database
5. Response flows back through the chain
6. UI updates with real data

## üé® Visual Improvements

- **Loading States**: Spinners and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Success Feedback**: Notifications for successful operations
- **Dynamic Content**: Real-time updates based on API data
- **Responsive Design**: Maintained while adding new functionality

## üìù Notes

- All dummy data has been replaced with API calls
- Fallback handling for offline or error scenarios
- Token-based authentication integrated
- File upload capabilities added
- Form validations enhanced with backend rules
- Performance optimized with loading states

The frontend now provides a complete, production-ready experience with real data integration! üéâ
